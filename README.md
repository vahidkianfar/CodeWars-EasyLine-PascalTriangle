# CodeWars-EasyLine-PascalTriangle (with drawing the Pascal Triangle)

In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, horizontal lines are numbered from zero (top).

We want to calculate the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on a given horizontal line with a function called easyline (or easyLine or easy-line).

Can you write a program which calculate easyline(n) where n is the horizontal line number?

The function will take n (with: n>= 0) as parameter and will return the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients on line n.

Examples:
easyline(0) => 1
easyline(1) => 2
easyline(4) => 70
